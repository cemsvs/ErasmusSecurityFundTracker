## 📖 Project Overview
Preparing for an Erasmus exchange program requires more than just a grant. Students often face startup costs (deposit, visa, flight) and monthly gaps due to exchange rate fluctuations. 

**Erasmus Security Fund Tracker** is a desktop application engineered to:
1.  **Calculate & Track** a personal "Safety Fund" goal.
2.  **Monitor** real-time currency value (EUR to TRY) to make informed financial decisions.
3.  **Simulate** professional data persistence using a custom-built framework.
