## 📖 Project Overview
Preparing for an Erasmus exchange program requires more than just a grant. Students often face startup costs (deposit, visa, flight) and monthly gaps due to exchange rate fluctuations. 

**Erasmus Security Fund Tracker** is a desktop application engineered to:
1.  **Calculate & Track** a personal "Safety Fund" goal.
2.  **Monitor** real-time currency values (**EUR to TRY, USD, PLN, etc.**) to make informed financial decisions.
3.  **Simulate** professional data persistence using a custom-built framework.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🌍 Multi-Currency Support:** Now supports 8+ major currencies (TRY, USD, GBP, PLN, NOK, SEK, DKK, CHF) with automatic exchange rate fetching.
* **⚡ Smart Input UX:** Enhanced data entry with auto-select numeric fields and intuitive income/expense toggles.
* **💰 Dynamic Goal Setting:** Users can configure their target fund based on the destination country's economic conditions.
* **📡 Live FX Rate API:** Integrates with the **Frankfurter REST API** to display real-time exchange rates via asynchronous calls.
* **💾 Custom Persistence Layer:** Utilizes the custom **[SaveSystemFramework](https://github.com/cemsvs/SaveSystemFramework)** for JSON-based data storage.
* **📊 Transaction History:** A reverse-chronological list of all deposits with visual tags ([+] Income / [-] Expense).
* **🎨 Responsive UI:** Built with Windows Forms using professional anchoring for full-screen support.
